# NoTankControls

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that allows you to move with your joysticks while holding any tool.

Resonite disables the joystick if you have a tooltip equipped which makes use of the "Secondary" action
(pressing down on that same joystick.)
This mod removes that restriction, allowing tools to be equipped while keeping full movement intact.

This version of the mod also has an option to enable compatibility with the InspectorScroll mod. When this is enabled and you point at UIX while holding a tool that stick's locomotion input will be disabled to allow for easier scrolling of the inspector.

## Installation
1. Install the modloader.
2. Place [NoTankControls.dll](https://github.com/Nytra/NoTankControls/releases/download/v1.1.0/NoTankControls.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your game logs, or try moving around with the DevToolTip equipped!
